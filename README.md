# DIMe
DIMe is a simple twitter-like social network built with SvelteJS, Typescript and Firebase. 

After the login you are allowed to search for users, follow/unfollow, create simple text posts, have an overview of your profile as well as others', add likes...

The app logic is implemented with the singleton pattern: there's a Firebase object that contains the typescript funcitons used to manage reads/writes.
The UI has simple styles written in Sass.
